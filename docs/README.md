# Docs index

One line per doc. `Status` is `current` (trust it) or `archived` (history only, don't follow it).
This table is the source of truth for what exists — if a doc isn't listed here, treat it as
undiscoverable until it is. Keep this under 100 lines; anything that doesn't fit gets archived.

| `docs/modernization/README.md` (private repo, not linkable from here) | Architecture audit + modernization plan | current | 2026-09-10 — still in the private repo, deliberately deferred (see WS2-T2.6 Outcome) |

## Not yet written

These are named in the modernization plan but don't exist yet — don't link to them until their task lands:
`docs/how-to/add-a-stream-source.md` (WS4-T4.7).

## Deliberately not moved from the private repo (WS2-T2.6)

`docs/modernization/**` (this session's own live execution record — moving it mid-task was too
risky), `docs/RULES.md`, `docs/project.md`, `docs/running-tests.md`, `docs/tasks-log.md`,
`docs/planning.md`, `.github/skills/*` (skill-invocation path risk, and `run-tasks` is now
private-repo-`tasks/`-specific), and ~20 undifferentiated docs (benchmark worklogs, per-feature
plans) that need individual triage, not a bulk mechanical move. See
`docs/modernization/workstreams/WS2-docs-and-tasks.md` T2.6 Outcome for the full list and reasoning.
